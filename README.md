# Daily-Journal
A full stack development of a daily journal. 

I use the Express module for my server to load up EJS templates to the client. 

The homepage loaded by the server will consist of an introduction, as well as all journal entries truncated and listed.
Each entry will have the option to be displayed in full in its own web page.

To-Do:
Add database to store entries.
Develop API to handle communication between the server and database.
